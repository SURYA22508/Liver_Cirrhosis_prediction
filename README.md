## **Liver Cirrhosis Prediction System — Project Description**

Developed a machine learning–based prediction system to identify the risk of **liver cirrhosis** using patient medical data. The aim was to assist early diagnosis by analyzing key clinical features and generating a reliable risk score.

### **🔍 Objectives**

* Predict the likelihood of liver cirrhosis in patients.
* Identify the most influential medical factors contributing to cirrhosis.
* Build a model that can support early medical intervention.

### **🛠 Tools & Technologies**

* **Python**, Pandas, NumPy
* **Scikit-learn** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM)
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (Data visualization)
* Jupyter Notebook

### **📊 Approach**

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent records from the medical dataset.
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Analyzed correlations between features such as bilirubin levels, albumin, enzymes, and patient age.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Standardized medical attributes and selected meaningful predictors for improved accuracy.
4. **Model Building:** Trained multiple ML models (KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).
5. **Model Evaluation:** Compared performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
6. **Best Model Selection:** Chose the model offering the best balance of accuracy and medical interpretability.

### **🏆 Outcomes**

* Achieved high accuracy in predicting liver cirrhosis risk.
* Identified important clinical indicators for diagnosis.
* Delivered a model capable of assisting doctors in early detection and treatment planning.

### **✨ Project Impact**

This system demonstrates how **machine learning can support healthcare** by providing data-driven insights for early disease prediction and improving patient outcomes.
